        "abstract": "The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.",

        "abstract": "Hypergraphs provide an effective modeling approach for modeling high-order relationships in many real-world datasets. To capture such complex relationships, several hypergraph neural networks have been proposed for learning hypergraph structure, which propagate information from nodes to hyperedges and then from hyperedges back to nodes. However, most existing methods focus on information propagation between hyperedges and nodes, neglecting the interactions among hyperedges themselves. In this paper, we propose HeIHNN, a hyperedge interaction-aware hypergraph neural network, which captures the interactions among hyperedges during the convolution process and introduce a novel mechanism to enhance information flow between hyperedges and nodes. Specifically, HeIHNN integrates the interactions between hyperedges into the hypergraph convolution by constructing a three-stage information propagation process. After propagating information from nodes to hyperedges, we introduce a hyperedge-level convolution to update the hyperedge embeddings. Finally, the embeddings that capture rich information from the interaction among hyperedges will be utilized to update the node embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a hyperedge outlier removal mechanism in the information propagation stages between nodes and hyperedges, which dynamically adjusts the hypergraph structure using the learned embeddings, effectively removing outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show the competitive performance of HeIHNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We consider hypergraph network design problems where the goal is to construct a hypergraph that satisfies certain connectivity requirements. For graph network design problems where the goal is to construct a graph that satisfies certain connectivity requirements, the number of edges in every feasible solution is at most quadratic in the number of vertices. In contrast, for hypergraph network design problems, we might have feasible solutions in which the number of hyperedges is exponential in the number of vertices. This presents an additional technical challenge in hypergraph network design problems compared to graph network design problems: in order to solve the problem in polynomial time, we first need to show that there exists a feasible solution in which the number of hyperedges is polynomial in the input size. The central theme of this work is to show that certain hypergraph network design problems admit solutions in which the number of hyperedges is polynomial in the number of vertices and moreover, can be solved in strongly polynomial time. Our work improves on the previous fastest pseudo-polynomial run-time for these problems. In addition, we develop strongly polynomial time algorithms that return near-uniform hypergraphs as solutions (i.e., every pair of hyperedges differ in size by at most one). As applications of our results, we derive the first strongly polynomial time algorithms for (i) degree-specified hypergraph connectivity augmentation using hyperedges, (ii) degree-specified hypergraph node-to-area connectivity augmentation using hyperedges, and (iii) degree-constrained mixed-hypergraph connectivity augmentation using hyperedges.",

Consequently, current approaches for data modelling either ignore the higher-order interactions altogether or simplify them into pairwise connections. In order to facilitate higher-order processing, even when a hypergraph structure is not available, we introduce Structural Prediction using Hypergraph Inference Network (SPHINX), a model that learns to infer a latent hypergraph structure in an unsupervised way, solely from the final node-level signal. The model consists of a soft, differentiable clustering method used to sequentially predict, for each hyperedge, the probability distribution over the nodes and a sampling algorithm that converts them into an explicit hypergraph structure. We show that the recent advancement in k-subset sampling represents a suitable tool for producing discrete hypergraph structures, addressing some of the training instabilities exhibited by prior works. The resulting model can generate the higher-order structure necessary for any modern hypergraph neural network, facilitating the capture of higher-order interaction in domains where annotating them is difficult. Through extensive ablation studies and experiments conducted on two challenging datasets for trajectory prediction, we demonstrate that our model is capable of inferring suitable latent hypergraphs, that are interpretable and enhance the final performance.",

In our previous work, we obtained an asymptotically tight upper bound via its connection to the joints problem, a problem in incidence geometry. In a different direction, Friedgut and Kahn generalized the Kruskal--Katona theorem by determining the maximum number of copies of any fixed hypergraph in an $n$-edge hypergraph, up to a multiplicative factor. In this paper, using the connection to the joints problem again, we generalize our previous work to show an analogous partial shadow phenomenon for any hypergraph, generalizing Friedgut and Kahn's result. The key idea is to encode the graph-theoretic problem with new kinds of joints that we call hypergraph joints. Our main theorem is a generalization of the joints theorem that upper bounds the number of hypergraph joints, which the partial shadow phenomenon immediately follows from.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end efficient knowledge hypergraph embedding model, HyCubE, which designs a novel 3D circular convolutional neural network and the alternate mask stack strategy to enhance the interaction and extraction of feature information comprehensively. Furthermore, our proposed model achieves a better trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency by adaptively adjusting the 3D circular convolutional layer structure to handle n-ary knowledge tuples of different arities with fewer parameters. In addition, we use a knowledge hypergraph 1-N multilinear scoring way to accelerate the model training efficiency further. Finally, extensive experimental results on all datasets demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with an average improvement of 8.22% and a maximum improvement of 33.82% across all metrics. Meanwhile, HyCubE is 6.12x faster, GPU memory usage is 52.67% lower, and the number of parameters is reduced by 85.21% compared with the average metric of the latest state-of-the-art baselines.",

Such a modeling choice typically involves an underlying projection process that maps the original hypergraph onto a graph, and is common in graph-based analysis. While hypergraph projection can potentially lead to loss of higher-order relations, there exists very limited studies on the consequences of doing so, as well as its remediation. This work fills this gap by doing two things: (1) we develop analysis based on graph and set theory, showing two ubiquitous patterns of hyperedges that are root to structural information loss in all hypergraph projections; we also quantify the combinatorial impossibility of recovering the lost higher-order structures if no extra help is provided; (2) we still seek to recover the lost higher-order structures in hypergraph projection, and in light of (1)'s findings we propose to relax the problem into a learning-based setting.

Higher-order link prediction is the task of predicting the existence of a missing hyperedge in a hypergraph. A hyperedge representation learned for higher order link prediction is fully expressive when it does not lose distinguishing power up to an isomorphism. Many existing hypergraph representation learners, are bounded in expressive power by the Generalized Weisfeiler Lehman-1 (GWL-1) algorithm, a generalization of the Weisfeiler Lehman-1 algorithm. However, GWL-1 has limited expressive power. In fact, induced subhypergraphs with identical GWL-1 valued nodes are indistinguishable. Furthermore, message passing on hypergraphs can already be computationally expensive, especially on GPU memory. To address these limitations, we devise a preprocessing algorithm that can identify certain regular subhypergraphs exhibiting symmetry. Our preprocessing algorithm runs once with complexity the size of the input hypergraph. During training, we randomly replace subhypergraphs identified by the algorithm with covering hyperedges to break symmetry. We show that our method improves the expressivity of GWL-1. Our extensive experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for higher-order link prediction on both graph and hypergraph datasets with negligible change in computation.",

Moreover, GNNs are inherently limited to encoding local neighborhood information using message-passing mechanisms, thus lacking the ability to model higher-order dependencies among nodes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-Enhanced DuAL framework named HEAL for semi-supervised graph classification, which captures graph semantics from the perspective of the hypergraph and the line graph, respectively. Specifically, to better explore the higher-order relationships among nodes, we design a hypergraph structure learning to adaptively learn complex node dependencies beyond pairwise relations. Meanwhile, based on the learned hypergraph, we introduce a line graph to capture the interaction between hyperedges, thereby better mining the underlying semantic structures. Finally, we develop a relational consistency learning to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two branches and provide better mutual guidance.

Nevertheless, the data heterogeneity across different domains inevitably influences the overall performance of federated learning. In this study, we propose FedHCDR, a novel Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation framework with Hypergraph signal decoupling. Specifically, to address the data heterogeneity across domains, we introduce an approach called hypergraph signal decoupling (HSD) to decouple the user features into domain-exclusive and domain-shared features. The approach employs high-pass and low-pass hypergraph filters to decouple domain-exclusive and domain-shared user representations, which are trained by the local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm. In addition, a hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) module is devised to enhance the learning of domain-shared user relationship information by perturbing the user hypergraph.

A CUR-based second-order graph matching algorithm is used to provide a rough match, and then the core of CURSOR, a fiber-CUR-based tensor generation method, directly calculates entries of the compatibility tensor by leveraging the initial second-order match result. This significantly decreases the time complexity and tensor density. A probability relaxation labeling (PRL)-based matching algorithm, especially suitable for sparse tensors, is developed. Experiment results on large-scale synthetic datasets and widely-adopted benchmark sets demonstrate the superiority of CURSOR over existing methods.

The player then selects a set of $s-r$ vertices $V$ and adds the hyperedge $U \\cup V$ to the $s$-uniform hypergraph. For a fixed (monotone) increasing graph property, the player's objective is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. We focus on the case where the player's objective is to construct a subgraph isomorphic to an arbitrary, fixed hypergraph $H$. In the case $r=1$ the threshold for the number of rounds required was already known in terms of the degeneracy of $H$. In the case $2 \\le r < s$, we give upper and lower bounds on this threshold for general $H$, and find further improved upper bounds for cliques in particular.

We synthesize new nodes based on samples from minority classes and their neighbors.

Such layers introduce higher-order structural inductive bias into the language model, thus improving the model's capacity to harness both higher-order context information from the hypergraph structure and semantic information present in text. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, HyperBERT, a mixed text-hypergraph model which simultaneously models hypergraph relational structure while maintaining the high-quality text encoding capabilities of a pre-trained BERT. Notably, HyperBERT presents results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on five challenging text-attributed hypergraph node classification benchmarks.",

HYGENE works on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of connected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At each step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a denoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global structure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of properties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work aims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.",

Traditional trust prediction models rely on pairwise correlations to infer potential relationships between users. However, in the real world, interactions between users are usually complicated rather than pairwise only. Hypergraphs offer a flexible approach to modeling these complex high-order correlations (not just pairwise connections), since hypergraphs can leverage hyperedeges to link more than two nodes. However, most hypergraph-based methods are generic and cannot be well applied to the trust prediction task. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hypergraph Network for Trust Prediction (AHNTP), a novel approach that improves trust prediction accuracy by using higher-order correlations. AHNTP utilizes Motif-based PageRank to capture high-order social influence information. In addition, it constructs hypergroups from both node-level and structure-level attributes to incorporate complex correlation information. Furthermore, AHNTP leverages adaptive hypergraph Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layers and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to generate comprehensive user embeddings, facilitating trust relationship prediction. To enhance model generalization and robustness, we introduce a novel supervised contrastive learning loss for optimization.

Inspired by the latest theoretical spectral clustering frameworks, such as HyperEF and HyperSF, SHyPar aims to decompose large hypergraphs into multiple subgraphs with few inter-partition hyperedges (cut size). A key component of SHyPar is a flow-based local clustering scheme for hypergraph coarsening, which incorporates a max-flow-based algorithm to produce clusters with substantially improved conductance. Additionally, SHyPar utilizes an effective resistance-based rating function for merging nodes that are strongly connected (coupled).

However, it is noticed that the high-order modeling capability of hypergraph also brings increased computation complexity, which hinders its practical industrial deployment. In practice, we find that one key barrier to the efficient deployment of HGNNs is the high-order structural dependencies during inference. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between the HGNNs and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) to eliminate the hypergraph dependency of HGNNs and thus reduce computational complexity as well as improve inference speed. Specifically, we introduce LightHGNN and LightHGNN$^+$ for fast inference with low complexity. LightHGNN directly distills the knowledge from teacher HGNNs to student MLPs via soft labels, and LightHGNN$^+$ further explicitly injects reliable high-order correlations into the student MLPs to achieve topology-aware distillation and resistance to over-smoothing. Experiments on eight hypergraph datasets demonstrate that even without hypergraph dependency, the proposed LightHGNNs can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and outperform vanilla MLPs by $16.3$ on average. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets further show the average best performance of our LightHGNNs compared with all other methods. Experiments on synthetic hypergraphs with 5.5w vertices indicate LightHGNNs can run $100\\times$ faster than HGNNs, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.",

To overcome the discrepancy between pretraining and downstream tasks, text-based instructions are applied to provide explicit guidance on specific tasks for representation learning. Compared to learnable prompts, whose effectiveness depends on the quality and the diversity of training data, text-based instructions intrinsically encapsulate task information and support the model to generalize beyond the structure seen during pretraining. To capture high-order relations with task information in a context-aware manner, a novel prompting hypergraph convolution layer is devised to integrate instructions into information propagation in hypergraphs.

Numerous recommendation algorithms are designed to provide users with a personalized array of information tailored to their preferences. Nevertheless, excessive personalization can confine users within a `filter bubble`. Consequently, achieving the right balance between accuracy and diversity in recommendations is a pressing concern. To address this challenge, exemplified by music recommendation, we introduce the Diversified Weighted Hypergraph music Recommendation algorithm (DWHRec). In the DWHRec algorithm, the initial connections between users and listened tracks are represented by a weighted hypergraph. Simultaneously, associations between artists, albums and tags with tracks are also appended to the hypergraph. To explore users' latent preferences, a hypergraph-based random walk embedding method is applied to the constructed hypergraph. In our investigation, accuracy is gauged by the alignment between the user and the track, whereas the array of recommended track types measures diversity. We rigorously compared DWHRec against seven state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms using two real-world music datasets. The experimental results validate DWHRec as a solution that adeptly harmonizes accuracy and diversity, delivering a more enriched musical experience. Beyond music recommendation, DWHRec can be extended to cater to other scenarios with similar data structures.",

To overcome this challenge, we utilize hypergraph as a new tool to vertically unify computing, communication, and task aspects of IoT systems for an effective matching by accurately capturing the relationships between tasks and communication and computing resources. Specifically, a state-of-the-art task-resource matching hypergraph (TRM-hypergraph) model is proposed in this paper, which is used to effectively transform the process of allocating complex heterogeneous resources to convoluted tasks into a hypergraph matching problem. Taking into account computational complexity and storage, a game-theoretic hypergraph matching algorithm is proposed via considering the hypergraph matching problem as a non-cooperative multi-player clustering game.

For the scenario of linear dilution, which roughly correspond to constant ventilation per person as required in many building codes, we see essentially no impact from introducing small hyperedges up to size 15 whereas we do see effects when the hyperedge set is dominated by large hyperedges. Specifically, we track the mean infections after the SIRS epidemic has run for awhile so it is in a `steady state` and find the mean is higher in the large hyperedge regime wheras it is unchanged from pairwise to small hyperedge regime.",

However, current progress often neglects the intricate high-order correlation of geometry and texture within 3D objects, leading to challenges such as over-smoothness, over-saturation and the Janus problem. In this work, we propose a method named ``3D Gaussian Generation via Hypergraph (Hyper-3DG)'', designed to capture the sophisticated high-order correlations present within 3D objects. Our framework is anchored by a well-established mainflow and an essential module, named ``Geometry and Texture Hypergraph Refiner (HGRefiner)''. This module not only refines the representation of 3D Gaussians but also accelerates the update process of these 3D Gaussians by conducting the Patch-3DGS Hypergraph Learning on both explicit attributes and latent visual features. Our framework allows for the production of finely generated 3D objects within a cohesive optimization, effectively circumventing degradation. Extensive experimentation has shown that our proposed method significantly enhances the quality of 3D generation while incurring no additional computational overhead for the underlying framework.

However, with the development of technology, the increasing size and complexity of data, and the lack of labels for relevant abnormal data, it is becoming increasingly challenging to perform effective and accurate anomaly detection in high-dimensional and complex data sets. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph based spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network model STGCN_Hyper, which explicitly captures high-order, multi-hop correlations between multiple variables through a hypergraph based dynamic graph structure learning module. On this basis, we further use the hypergraph based spatiotemporal graph convolutional network to utilize the learned hypergraph structure to effectively propagate and aggregate one-hop and multi-hop related node information in the convolutional network, thereby obtaining rich spatial information. Furthermore, through the multi-scale TCN dilated convolution module, the STGCN_hyper model can also capture the dependencies of features at different scales in the temporal dimension. An unsupervised anomaly detector based on PCA and GMM is also integrated into the STGCN_hyper model. Through the anomaly score of the detector, the model can detect the anomalies in an unsupervised way. Experimental results on multiple time series datasets show that our model can flexibly learn the multi-scale time series features in the data and the dependencies between features, and outperforms most existing baseline models in terms of precision, recall, F1-score on anomaly detection tasks.

Specifically, to comprehensively understand an individual's behavior from low-quality records, we leverage the powerful associative ability of LLMs by designing an effective prompt. In this way, LLMs can integrate various scattered information with their external knowledge to generate higher-quality profiles, which can significantly improve the personality analysis performance. To explore the interactive mechanism behind the users and their online environments, we design an effective hypergraph neural network where the hypergraph nodes are users and the hyperedges in the hypergraph are social environments. We offer a useful dataset with user profile data, personality traits, and several detected environments from the real-world social platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network-based dataset containing both hypergraph structure and social information, which could push forward future research in this area further.

In the regime $n^{-1}\\ll n^{k-2}p \\ll n^{-1/r}$ we establish a threshold such that if the number of initially infected vertices remains below the threshold, then with high probability only a few additional vertices become infected, while if the number of initially infected vertices exceeds the threshold then with high probability almost every vertex becomes infected. In fact we show that the probability of failure decreases exponentially.",

Metrics for individual player rankings often fail to consider the interaction effects between groups of players, while methods for assessing full lineups cannot be used to identify the value of lower-order combinations of players (pairs, trios, etc.). Given that player and lineup rankings are inherently dependent on each other, these limitations may affect the accuracy of performance evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel adjusted box score plus-minus (APM) approach that allows for the simultaneous ranking of individual players, lower-order combinations of players, and full lineups. The method adjusts for the complete dependency structure and is motivated by the connection between APM and the hypergraph representation of a team. We discuss the similarities of our approach to other advanced metrics, demonstrate it using NBA data from 2012-2022, and suggest potential directions for future work.",

The (rating) matrix completion is essentially a rating prediction process, which is also a significant problem in recommender systems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in matrix completion, which captures users' preferences over items by formulating a rating matrix as a bipartite graph. However, existing methods are susceptible due to data sparsity and long-tail distribution in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the messaging mechanism of GNNs makes it difficult to capture high-order correlations and constraints between nodes, which are essentially useful in recommendation tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning framework for matrix completion, named MHCL. Specifically, MHCL adaptively learns hypergraph structures to capture high-order correlations between nodes and jointly captures local and global collaborative relationships through attention-based cross-view aggregation. Additionally, to consider the magnitude and order information of ratings, we treat different rating subgraphs as different channels, encourage alignment between adjacent ratings, and further achieve the mutual enhancement between different ratings through multi-channel cross-rating contrastive learning.

Most hypergraph learning research focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant but more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is only recently proposed. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node-edge pairs instead of single nodes or hyperedges. Existing solutions for this task are based on message passing and model interactions in within-edge and within-node structures as multi-input single-output functions. This brings three limitations: (1) non-adaptive representation size, (2) non-adaptive messages, and (3) insufficient direct interactions among nodes or edges. To tackle these limitations, we propose CoNHD, a new ENC solution that models both within-edge and within-node interactions as multi-input multi-output functions.

Specifically, we review and propose an extension to a recently introduced node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality model which provides mutually dependent node and edge centralities. A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae protein complex hypernetwork is used as an example application with nodes representing proteins and hyperedges representing protein complexes. The resulting rankings of the nodes and edges are considered to see if they provide insight into the essentiality of the proteins and complexes. We find that certain variations of the model predict essentiality more accurately and that the degree-based variation illustrates that the centrality-lethality rule extends to a hypergraph setting. In particular, through exploitation of the models flexibility, we identify small sets of proteins densely populated with essential proteins. One of the key advantages of applying this model to a protein complex hypernetwork is that it also provides a classification method for protein complexes, unlike previous approaches which are only concerned with classifying proteins.",

In this work, we show that the connection between the container method and property testing extends further along two different directions. First, we show that the container method can be used to analyze the canonical tester for many other properties of graphs and hypergraphs. We introduce a new hypergraph container lemma and use it to give an upper bound of $\\widetilde{O}(kq^3/\\epsilon)$ on the sample complexity of $\\epsilon$-testing satisfiability, where $q$ is the number of variables per constraint and $k$ is the size of the alphabet.

As a corollary, we get new upper bounds on the sample complexity of the canonical testers for hypergraph colorability and for every semi-homogeneous graph partition property. Second, we show that the container method can also be used to study the query complexity of (non-canonical) graph property testers. This result is obtained by introducing a new container lemma for the class of all independent set stars, a strict superset of the class of all independent sets.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of both image retrieval and pixel retrieval. Traditional diffusion methods struggle to propagate spatial information effectively in conventional graphs due to their reliance on scalar edge weights. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hypergraph-based framework, uniquely capable of efficiently propagating spatial information using local features during query time, thereby accurately retrieving and localizing objects within a database. Additionally, we innovatively utilize the structural information of the image graph through a technique we term `community selection`. This approach allows for the assessment of the initial search result's uncertainty and facilitates an optimal balance between accuracy and speed. This is particularly crucial in real-world applications where such trade-offs are often necessary. Our experimental results, conducted on the (P)ROxford and (P)RParis datasets, demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over existing diffusion techniques. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in both image-level and pixel-level retrieval, while also maintaining impressive processing speed. This dual achievement underscores the effectiveness of our hypergraph-based framework and community selection technique, marking a notable advancement in the field of content-based image retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Quality-of-Service (QoS) prediction is a critical task in the service lifecycle, enabling precise and adaptive service recommendations by anticipating performance variations over time in response to evolving network uncertainties and user preferences. However, contemporary QoS prediction methods frequently encounter data sparsity and cold-start issues, which hinder accurate QoS predictions and limit the ability to capture diverse user preferences. Additionally, these methods often assume QoS data reliability, neglecting potential credibility issues such as outliers and the presence of greysheep users and services with atypical invocation patterns. Furthermore, traditional approaches fail to leverage diverse features, including domain-specific knowledge and complex higher-order patterns, essential for accurate QoS predictions. In this paper, we introduce a real-time, trust-aware framework for temporal QoS prediction to address the aforementioned challenges, featuring an end-to-end deep architecture called the Hypergraph Convoluted Transformer Network (HCTN). HCTN combines a hypergraph structure with graph convolution over hyper-edges to effectively address high-sparsity issues by capturing complex, high-order correlations. Complementing this, the transformer network utilizes multi-head attention along with parallel 1D convolutional layers and fully connected dense blocks to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained dynamic patterns. Additionally, our approach includes a sparsity-resilient solution for detecting greysheep users and services, incorporating their unique characteristics to improve prediction accuracy.

        "abstract": "Text-video retrieval is a challenging task that aims to identify relevant videos given textual queries. Compared to conventional textual retrieval, the main obstacle for text-video retrieval is the semantic gap between the textual nature of queries and the visual richness of video content. Previous works primarily focus on aligning the query and the video by finely aggregating word-frame matching signals. Inspired by the human cognitive process of modularly judging the relevance between text and video, the judgment needs high-order matching signal due to the consecutive and complex nature of video contents. In this paper, we propose chunk-level text-video matching, where the query chunks are extracted to describe a specific retrieval unit, and the video chunks are segmented into distinct clips from videos. We formulate the chunk-level matching as n-ary correlations modeling between words of the query and frames of the video and introduce a multi-modal hypergraph for n-ary correlation modeling. By representing textual units and video frames as nodes and using hyperedges to depict their relationships, a multi-modal hypergraph is constructed. In this way, the query and the video can be aligned in a high-order semantic space. In addition, to enhance the model's generalization ability, the extracted features are fed into a variational inference component for computation, obtaining the variational representation under the Gaussian distribution. The incorporation of hypergraphs and variational inference allows our model to capture complex, n-ary interactions among textual and visual contents. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the text-video retrieval task.",

        "abstract": "Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to classify target samples by only accessing a pre-trained source model and unlabelled target samples. Since no source data is available, transferring the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain is challenging. Existing methods normally exploit the pair-wise relation among target samples and attempt to discover their correlations by clustering these samples based on semantic features. The drawback of these methods includes: 1) the pair-wise relation is limited to exposing the underlying correlations of two more samples, hindering the exploration of the structural information embedded in the target domain; 2) the clustering process only relies on the semantic feature, while overlooking the critical effect of domain shift, i.e., the distribution differences between the source and target domains. To address these issues, we propose a new SFDA method that exploits the high-order neighborhood relation and explicitly takes the domain shift effect into account. Specifically, we formulate the SFDA as a Hypergraph learning problem and construct hyperedges to explore the local group and context information among multiple samples. Moreover, we integrate a self-loop strategy into the constructed hypergraph to elegantly introduce the domain uncertainty of each sample. By clustering these samples based on hyperedges, both the semantic feature and domain shift effects are considered. We then describe an adaptive relation-based objective to tune the model with soft attention levels for all samples.

In this paper, we present HINTs, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) as both a general NLP task solver and an intelligent agent. By leveraging the extraction capability of LLMs in the data preparation stage, we model the corpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when making sense of the corpus. The constructed hypergraph is hierarchically organized with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate sensemaking. To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study. We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking. We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are necessary to address the new problems brought by intelligent agents.

In this model, $n$ vertices are randomly divided into two communities, and size-$r$ hyperedges are added randomly depending on whether all vertices in the hyperedge are in the same community. The goal of weak recovery is to recover a non-trivial fraction of the communities given the hypergraph. Pal and Zhu (2021); Stephan and Zhu (2022) established that weak recovery is always possible above a natural threshold called the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. For assortative models (i.e., monochromatic hyperedges are preferred), Gu and Polyanskiy (2023) proved that the KS threshold is tight if $r\\le 4$ or the expected degree $d$ is small. For other cases, the tightness of the KS threshold remained open. In this paper we determine the tightness of the KS threshold for a wide range of parameters. We prove that for $r\\le 6$ and $d$ large enough, the KS threshold is tight. This shows that there is no information-computation gap in this regime and partially confirms a conjecture of Angelini et al. (2015). On the other hand, we show that for $r\\ge 5$, there exist parameters for which the KS threshold is not tight. In particular, for $r\\ge 7$, the KS threshold is not tight if the model is disassortative (i.e., polychromatic hyperedges are preferred) or $d$ is large enough. This provides more evidence supporting the existence of an information-computation gap in these cases. Furthermore, we establish asymptotic bounds on the weak recovery threshold for fixed $r$ and large $d$. We also obtain a number of results regarding the broadcasting on hypertrees (BOHT) model, including the asymptotics of the reconstruction threshold for $r\\ge 7$ and impossibility of robust reconstruction at criticality.",

We present a protocol that prepares the codespace of constant-rate hypergraph product codes in constant depth with $O(\\sqrt{n})$ spatial overhead, and we show that the protocol is robust even in the presence of measurement errors.

However, the continuous influx of pull requests and the limited pool of available reviewer candidates pose a significant challenge to the review process, making the task of assigning suitable reviewers to each review request increasingly difficult. To tackle this issue, we present MIRRec, a novel code reviewer recommendation method that leverages a hypergraph with multiplex relationships. MIRRec encodes high-order correlations that go beyond traditional pairwise connections using degree-free hyperedges among pull requests and developers. This way, it can capture high-order implicit connectivity and identify potential reviewers. To validate the effectiveness of MIRRec, we conducted experiments using a dataset comprising 48,374 pull requests from ten popular open-source software projects hosted on GitHub. The experiment results demonstrate that MIRRec, especially without PR-Review Commenters relationship, outperforms existing stateof-the-art code reviewer recommendation methods in terms of ACC and MRR, highlighting its significance in improving the code review process.",

These subgraphs can capture more information about subgroups of vertices without limiting one vertex belonging to just one group, allowing vertices to belong to multiple groups or subgraphs.

It is common to represent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various graph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority of existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the following three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise correlations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture synchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the brain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the brain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy or disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns linked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we present HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal hypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel customized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal co-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain in both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all other baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks. Furthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical research on these brain disorders.

First, we provide a weighted hypergraph representation and demonstrate that non-symmetric GHZ states are local unitary (LU) equivalent to fully connected weighted hypergraphs. Although these weighted hypergraphs are not stabilizer states, we show that they can be stabilized using local operations, and an ancilla. We further extend this framework to qudits, offering a specific form for non-symmetric qudit GHZ states and their LU equivalent weighted qudit hypergraphs.

While there has been a lot of research on representation learning of structured EHR data, the fusion of different types of EHR data (multimodal fusion) is not well studied. This is mostly because of the complex medical coding systems used and the noise and redundancy present in the written notes. In this work, we propose a new framework called MINGLE, which integrates both structures and semantics in EHR effectively. Our framework uses a two-level infusion strategy to combine medical concept semantics and clinical note semantics into hypergraph neural networks, which learn the complex interactions between different types of data to generate visit representations for downstream prediction. Experiment results on two EHR datasets, the public MIMIC-III and private CRADLE, show that MINGLE can effectively improve predictive performance by 11.83% relatively, enhancing semantic integration as well as multimodal fusion for structural and textual EHR data.",

In \\cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete. In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.",

        "abstract": "Understanding of video creativity and content often varies among individuals, with differences in focal points and cognitive levels across different ages, experiences, and genders. There is currently a lack of research in this area, and most existing benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of modalities and answers with restrictive length; 2) the content and scenarios within the videos are excessively monotonous, transmitting allegories and emotions that are overly simplistic. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large-scale Subjective Response Indicators for Advertisement Videos dataset, namely SRI-ADV. Specifically, we collected real changes in Electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye-tracking regions from different demographics while they viewed identical video content. Utilizing this multi-modal dataset, we developed tasks and protocols to analyze and evaluate the extent of cognitive understanding of video content among different users. Along with the dataset, we designed a Hypergraph Multi-modal Large Language Model (HMLLM) to explore the associations among different demographics, video elements, EEG, and eye-tracking indicators. HMLLM could bridge semantic gaps across rich modalities and integrate information beyond different modalities to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental evaluations on SRI-ADV and other additional video-based generative performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The codes and dataset will be released at https://github.com/mininglamp-MLLM/HMLLM.",

One of our key results is that arbitrary hypergraphs do not satisfy a bound analogous to the one in the Burning Number Conjecture for graphs.

The edge-vertex incidence matrix is a matrix in which the rows represent hyperedges and the columns represent vertices. For a given hyperedge $e$ and vertex $u$, the $(e,u)$-th entry of the matrix is $1$ if $u$ is incident to $e$; otherwise, this entry is $0$. The vertex-edge incidence matrix is simply the transpose of the edge-vertex incidence matrix. This study examines the ranks and null spaces of these incidence matrices. It is shown that certain hypergraph structures, such as $k$-uniform cycles, units, and equal partitions of hyperedges and vertices, can influence specific vectors in the null space. In a hypergraph, a unit is a maximal collection of vertices that are incident with the same set of hyperedges. Identification of vertices within the same unit leads to a smaller hypergraph, known as unit contraction. The rank of the edge-vertex incidence matrix remains the same for both the original hypergraph and its unit contraction. Additionally, this study establishes connections between the edge-vertex incidence matrix and certain eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the hypergraph.",

Designing a generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs, however, is not straightforward. Questions remain with regard to its generative SSL task, connection to downstream tasks, and empirical properties of learned representations. In light of the promises and challenges, we propose a novel generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs. We first formulate a generative SSL task on hypergraphs, hyperedge filling, and highlight its theoretical connection to node classification.

In this work, we focus on a new generalization of a walk in a network that recovers previous approaches and allows for a description of permissible walks in hypergraphs. Permissible walk graphs are constructed by intersecting the attributed $s$-line graph of a hypergraph with a relation respecting graph. The attribution of the hypergraph's line graph commonly carries over information from categorical and temporal attributions of the original hypergraph. To demonstrate this approach on a temporally attributed example, we apply our framework to a Reddit data set composed of hyperedges as threads and authors as nodes where post times are tracked.",

Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.",

Compared to graphs, hypergraphs have the distinct advantage that they contain explicit communities and are more convenient to manipulate. An open problem in hypergraph research is how to accurately and efficiently calculate node distances on hypergraphs. Estimating node distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, which has important applications in such areas as recommender system, targeted advertising, etc. In this paper, we propose using expected hitting times of random walks to compute hypergraph node distances. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately compute node distances on highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random walks (FRW) for this task. We further benchmark our method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk alternative.",

However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to spectral graph theories, the formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and one result regarding hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is even incorrect. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of Both NCut and conductance.

The cardinality-based hypergraph cut function assigns a cut penalty to each hyperedge based on the number of nodes in the hyperedge that are on each side of the split. Previous work has shown that when hyperedge cut penalties are submodular, this problem can be reduced to a graph $s$-$t$ cut problem and hence solved in polynomial time. NP-hardness results are also known for a certain class of non-submodular penalties, though the complexity remained open in many parameter regimes. In this paper we highlight and leverage a connection to Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems to show that the problem is NP-hard for all non-submodular hyperedge cut penalty, except for one trivial case where a 0-cost solution is always possible. We then turn our attention to approximation strategies and approximation hardness results in the non-submodular case. We design a strategy for projecting non-submodular penalties to the submodular region, which we prove gives the optimal approximation among all such projection strategies. We also show that alternative approaches are unlikely to provide improved guarantees, by showing it is UGC-hard to obtain a better approximation in the simplest setting where all hyperedges have exactly 4 nodes.",

Publications to date about the IM problem focus mainly on graphs, which fail to capture high-order interaction relationships from the real world. Therefore, the use of hypergraphs for addressing the IM problem has been receiving increasing attention. However, identifying the most influential nodes in hypergraphs remains challenging, mainly because nodes and hyperedges are often strongly coupled and correlated. In this paper, to effectively identify the most influential nodes, we first propose a novel hypergraph-independent cascade model that integrates the influences of both node and hyperedge failures. Afterward, we introduce genetic algorithms (GA) to identify the most influential nodes that leverage hypergraph collective influences. In the GA-based method, the hypergraph collective influence is effectively used to initialize the population, thereby enhancing the quality of initial candidate solutions. The designed fitness function considers the joint influences of both nodes and hyperedges. This ensures the optimal set of nodes with the best influence on both nodes and hyperedges to be evaluated accurately. Moreover, a new mutation operator is designed by introducing factors, i.e., the collective influence and overlapping effects of nodes in hypergraphs, to breed high-quality offspring. In the experiments, several simulations on both synthetic and real hypergraphs have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods.",

Hypergraphs, which can model complex beyond-pairwise relationships, offer a more robust framework but are still underexplored in the context of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce LLM4Hypergraph, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 21,500 problems across eight low-order, five high-order, and two isomorphism tasks, utilizing both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs from citation networks and protein structures. We evaluate six prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrating our benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model strengths and weaknesses. Our specialized prompting framework incorporates seven hypergraph languages and introduces two novel techniques, Hyper-BAG and Hyper-COT, which enhance high-order reasoning and achieve an average 4% (up to 9%) performance improvement on structure classification tasks. This work establishes a foundational testbed for integrating hypergraph computational capabilities into LLMs, advancing their comprehension.

However, methods capable of inferring nonpairwise interactions are only starting to appear. Here, we develop an inference algorithm based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to reconstruct hypergraphs and simplicial complexes from time-series data. Our model-free method does not require information about node dynamics or coupling functions, making it applicable to complex systems that do not have a reliable mathematical description. We first benchmark the new method on synthetic data generated from Kuramoto and Lorenz dynamics.

        "abstract": "Recently, researchers have extended the concept of matchings to the more general problem of finding $b$-matchings in hypergraphs broadening the scope of potential applications and challenges. The concept of $b$-matchings, where $b$ is a function that assigns positive integers to the vertices of the graph, is a natural extension of matchings in graphs, where each vertex $v$ is allowed to be matched to up to $b(v)$ edges, rather than just one. The weighted $b$-matching problem then seeks to select a subset of the hyperedges that fulfills the constraint and maximizes the weight. In this work, we engineer novel algorithms for this generalized problem. More precisely, we introduce exact data reductions for the problem as well as a novel greedy initial solution and local search algorithms. These data reductions allow us to significantly shrink the input size. This is done by either determining if a hyperedge is guaranteed to be in an optimum $b$-matching and thus can be added to our solution or if it can be safely ignored. Our iterated local search algorithm provides a framework for finding suitable improvement swaps of edges. Experiments on a wide range of real-world hypergraphs show that our new set of data reductions are highly practical, and our initial solutions are competitive for graphs and hypergraphs as well.",

In particular, they asked to determine the uniform Tur\\'an densities of $K_4^{(3)-}$ and $K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved in [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and [J.

These methods, however, are often not directly applicable to more complex structures like bipartite graphs (equivalent to hypergraphs), which represent interactions among two entity types (e.g. a user liking a movie). This paper proposes Convolutional Signal Propagation (CSP), a non-parametric simple and scalable method that natively operates on bipartite graphs (hypergraphs) and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. After defining CSP, we demonstrate its relationship with well-established methods like label propagation, Naive Bayes, and Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. We evaluate CSP against several reference methods on real-world datasets from multiple domains, focusing on retrieval and classification tasks. Our results show that CSP offers competitive performance while maintaining low computational complexity, making it an ideal first choice as a baseline for hypergraph node classification and retrieval. Moreover, despite operating on hypergraphs, CSP achieves good results in tasks typically not associated with hypergraphs, such as natural language processing.",

Practically, individuals behave either altruistically or egoistically in multiple groups, such as relatives, friends and colleagues, and feedbacks from these groupwise interactions will contribute to one's cognition and behavior. Due to the intricacy within and between groups, exploration of evolutionary dynamics over hypergraphs is relatively limited to date. To uncover this conundrum, we develop a higher-order random walk framework for five distinct updating rules, thus establishing explicit conditions for cooperation emergence on hypergraphs, and finding the overlaps between groups tend to foster cooperative behaviors. Our systematic analysis quantifies how the order and hyperdegree govern evolutionary outcomes. We also discover that whenever following a group wisdom update protocol, choosing a high-fitness group to interact equally within its members, cooperators will significantly prevail throughout the community. These findings underscore a crucial role of higher-order interaction and interdisciplinary collaboration throughout a broad range of living systems, favoring social prosperity.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces a comprehensive framework that situates information cascades within the domain of higher-order interactions, utilizing a double-threshold hypergraph model. We propose that individuals (nodes) gain awareness of information through each communication channel (hyperedge) once the number of information adopters surpasses a threshold $\\phi_m$. However, actual adoption of the information only occurs when the cumulative influence across all communication channels exceeds a second threshold, $\\phi_k$. We analytically derive the cascade condition for both the case of a single seed node using percolation methods and the case of any seed size employing mean-field approximation. Our findings underscore that when considering the fractional seed size, $r_0 \\in (0,1]$, the connectivity pattern of the random hypergraph, characterized by the hyperdegree, $k$, and cardinality, $m$, distributions, exerts an asymmetric impact on the global cascade boundary. This asymmetry manifests in the observed differences in the boundaries of the global cascade within the $(\\phi_m, \\langle m \\rangle)$ and $(\\phi_k, \\langle k \\rangle)$ planes. However, as $r_0 \\to 0$, this asymmetric effect gradually diminishes. Overall, by elucidating the mechanisms driving information cascades within a broader context of higher-order interactions, our research contributes to theoretical advancements in complex systems theory.",

Subsequently, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art codes available to maximize hypergraph modularities for detecting node communities in binary hypergraphs. Through exploration of various simulation settings with controlled ground truth clustering, we offer a comparison of these methods using different quality measures, including true clustering recovery, running time, (local) maximization of the objective, and the number of clusters detected.

If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.",

These results are in stark contrast with the case of graphs, where a classical result of Erd\\H{o}s and Gallai provides an efficient algorithm for checking if a sequence is a degree sequence of a graph and a result of Pittel shows that with high probability a random partition is not the degree sequence of a graph. By the same method, we address analogous realizability problems about high-dimensional binary contingency tables. We prove that if $(\\lambda,\\mu,\\nu)$ are three independent random partitions then with high probability one can construct a three-dimensional binary contingency table with marginals $(\\lambda,\\mu,\\nu)$. Conversely, if one insists that the contingency table forms a pyramid shape, then we show that with high probability one cannot construct such a contingency table.

        "abstract": "The functionality of an entity frequently necessitates the support of a group situated in another layer of the system. To unravel the profound impact of such group support on a system's resilience against cascading failures, we devise a framework comprising a double-layer interdependent hypergraph system, wherein nodes are capable of receiving support via hyperedges. Our central hypothesis posits that the failure may transcend to another layer when all support groups of each dependent node fail, thereby initiating a potentially iterative cascade across layers. Through rigorous analytical methods, we derive the critical threshold for the initial node survival probability that marks the second-order phase transition point. A salient discovery is that as the prevalence of dependent nodes escalates, the system dynamics shift from a second-order to a first-order phase transition. Notably, irrespective of the collapse pattern, systems characterized by scale-free hyperdegree distributions within both hypergraph layers consistently demonstrate superior robustness compared to those adhering to Poisson hyperdegree distributions. In summary, our research underscores the paramount significance of group support mechanisms and intricate network topologies in determining the resilience of interconnected systems against the propagation of cascading failures. By exploring the interplay between these factors, we have gained insights into how systems can be designed or optimized to mitigate the risk of widespread disruptions, ensuring their continued functionality and stability in the face of adverse events.",

Recently, this result was greatly extended by R\\`aty, Sudakov, and Tomon. We build on the ideas of the latter, and use a semidefinite programming inspired approach to prove the following variant for hypergraphs: every $r$-uniform $d$-regular hypergraph on $n$ vertices (where $d\\ll n^{1/2}$) has a bisection of size at most $$\\frac{dn}{r}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{r-1}}-\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right),$$ for some $c=c(r)>0$. This bound is the best possible up to the precise value of $c$. Moreover, a bisection achieving this bound can be found by a polynomial-time randomized algorithm. The minimum bisection is closely related to discrepancy. We also prove sharp bounds on the discrepancy and so called positive discrepancy of hypergraphs, extending results of Bollob\\'as and Scott. Furthermore, we discuss implications about Alon-Boppana type bounds.

The higher-order nature of these interactions, involving many units at once, and their temporal dynamics constitute crucial properties that shape the behaviour of the system itself. An adequate description of these systems is offered by temporal hypergraphs, that integrate these features within the same framework. However, tools for their temporal and topological characterization are still scarce. Here we develop a series of methods specifically designed to analyse the structural properties of temporal hypergraphs at multiple scales. Leveraging the hyper-core decomposition of hypergraphs, we follow the evolution of the hyper-cores through time, characterizing the hypergraph structure and its temporal dynamics at different topological scales, and quantifying the multi-scale structural stability of the system. We also define two static hypercoreness centrality measures that provide an overall description of the nodes aggregated structural behaviour. We apply the characterization methods to several data sets, establishing connections between structural properties and specific activities within the systems. Finally, we show how the proposed method can be used as a model-validation tool for synthetic temporal hypergraphs, distinguishing the higher-order structures and dynamics generated by different models from the empirical ones, and thus identifying the essential model mechanisms to reproduce the empirical hypergraph structure and evolution. Our work opens several research directions, from the understanding of dynamic processes on temporal higher-order networks to the design of new models of time-varying hypergraphs.",

Later work by S\\'arkozy, Selkow and Szemer\\'edi showed that in fact Dirac graphs have many Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings, culminating in a result of Cuckler and Kahn that gives a precise description of the numbers of Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings in a Dirac graph G (in terms of an entropy-like parameter of G). In this paper we extend Cuckler and Kahn's result to perfect matchings in hypergraphs. For positive integers d < k, and for n divisible by k, let $m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum d-degree that ensures the existence of a perfect matching in an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph. In general, it is an open question to determine (even asymptotically) the values of $m_{d}(k,n)$, but we are nonetheless able to prove an analogue of the Cuckler-Kahn theorem, showing that if an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph G has minimum d-degree at least $(1+\\gamma)m_{d}(k,n)$ (for any constant $\\gamma>0$), then the number of perfect matchings in G is controlled by an entropy-like parameter of G.

        "abstract": "Interacting particle systems are known for their ability to generate large-scale self-organized structures from simple local interaction rules between each agent and its neighbors. In addition to studying their emergent behavior, a main focus of the mathematical community has been concentrated on deriving their large-population limit. In particular, the mean-field limit consists of describing the limit system by its population density in the product space of positions and labels. The strategy to derive such limits is often based on a careful combination of methods ranging from analysis of PDEs and stochastic analysis, to kinetic equations and graph theory. In this article, we focus on a generalization of multi-agent systems that includes higher-order interactions, which has largely captured the attention of the applied community in the last years. In such models, interactions between individuals are no longer assumed to be binary (i.e. between a pair of particles). Instead, individuals are allowed to interact by groups so that a full group jointly generates a non-linear force on any given individual. The underlying graph of connections is then replaced by a hypergraph, which we assume to be dense, but possibly non uniform and of unbounded rank. For the first time in the literature, we show that when the interaction kernels are regular enough, then the mean-field limit is determined by a limiting Vlasov-type equation, where the hypergraph limit is encoded by a so-called UR-hypergraphon (unbounded-rank hypergraphon), and where the resulting mean-field force admits infinitely-many orders of interactions.",

        "abstract": "We prove three main results about semialgebraic hypergraphs. First, we prove an optimal and oblivious regularity lemma. Fox, Pach, and Suk proved that the class of $k$-uniform semialgebraic hypergraphs satisfies a very strong regularity lemma where the vertex set can be partitioned into $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$ parts so that all but an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of $k$-tuples of parts are homogeneous (either complete or empty). Our result improves the number of parts in the partition to $O_{d,k}((D/\\varepsilon)^{d})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space and $D$ is a measure of the complexity of the hypergraph; additionally, the partition is oblivious to the edge set of the hypergraph. We give examples that show that the dependence on both $\\varepsilon$ and $D$ is optimal. From this regularity lemma we deduce the best-known Tur\\'an-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Third, we prove a Zarankiewicz-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Previously Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl showed that a $K_{u,u}$-free semialgebraic graph on $N$ vertices has at most $O_{d,D,u}(N^{2d/(d+1)+o(1)})$ edges and Do extended this result to $K_{u,\\ldots,u}^{(k)}$-free semialgebraic hypergraphs. We improve upon both of these results by removing the $o(1)$ in the exponent and making the dependence on $D$ and $u$ explicit and polynomial. All three of these results follow from a novel ``multilevel polynomial partitioning scheme'' that efficiently partitions a point set $P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ via low-complexity semialgebraic pieces. We prove this result using the polynomial method over varieties as developed by Walsh which extends the real polynomial partitioning technique of Guth and Katz. We give additional applications to the unit distance problem, the Erd\\H{o}s--Hajnal problem for semialgebraic graphs, and property testing of semialgebraic hypergraphs.",

While it is known that $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ for $k$-uniform hypergraphs that are not $k$-partite, estimates for hypergraphs that are $k$-partite (or degenerate) are not nearly as tight. In a recent breakthrough, Ferber, McKinley, and Samotij proved that for many degenerate hypergraphs $H$, $forb(n, H) = 2^{O(ex(n,H))}$. However, there are few known instances of degenerate hypergraphs $H$ for which $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds. In this paper, we show that $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds for a wide class of degenerate hypergraphs known as $2$-contractible hypertrees. This is the first known infinite family of degenerate hypergraphs $H$ for which $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds. As a corollary of our main results, we obtain a surprisingly sharp estimate of $forb(n,C^{(k)}_\\ell)=2^{(\\lfloor\\frac{\\ell-1}{2}\\rfloor+o(1))\\binom{n}{k-1}}$ for the $k$-uniform linear $\\ell$-cycle, for all pairs $k\\geq 5, \\ell\\geq 3$, thus settling a question of Balogh, Narayanan, and Skokan affirmatively for all $k\\geq 5, \\ell\\geq 3$. Our methods also lead to some related sharp results on the corresponding random Turan problem. As a key ingredient of our proofs, we develop a novel supersaturation variant of the delta systems method for set systems, which may be of independent interest.",

This gives a topological extension of Dirac's theorem and asymptotically confirms a conjecture of Georgakopoulos, Haslegrave, Montgomery, and Narayanan. Unlike typical results in the area, our proof does not rely on the Absorption Method, the Regularity Lemma or the Blow-up Lemma. Instead, we use a recently introduced framework that is based on covering the vertex set of the host graph with a family of complete blow-ups.",

Firstly, for a multilinear polynomial system on a uniform hypergraph, we study the stability of the origin of the corresponding systems. Next, we extend our results to non-homogeneous polynomial systems on non-uniform hypergraphs. We confirm that the local stability of any discrete-time polynomial system is in general dominated by pairwise terms. Assuming that the origin is locally stable, we construct a conservative (but explicit) region of attraction from the system parameters. Finally, we validate our results via some numerical examples.",

A particle reconstruction algorithm based on learning hypergraphs (HGPflow) has previously been explored in the context of single jets. In this paper, we expand the scope to full proton-proton and electron-positron collision events and study reconstruction quality using metrics at the particle, jet, and event levels. Rather than operating on the entire event in a single pass, we train HGPflow on smaller partitions to avoid potentially learning long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.",

As a consequence, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on the maximum sizes of focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes, thereby significantly improving the previous results of Alon and Holzman.

On the one hand, we provide a complete classification of the various possibilities in the ternary case. On the other hand, we provide an example of a family of slice-wise stable 3-hypergraphs so that for no partition of the vertices, any triple of parts has density close to 0 or 1. In particular, this addresses some questions and conjectures of Terry and Wolf. We work in the general measure theoretic context of graded probability spaces, so all our results apply both to measures in ultraproducts of finite graphs, leading to the aforementioned combinatorial applications, and to commuting definable Keisler measures, leading to applications in model theory.",

Hypergraphic posets include the weak order for the permutahedron (when $\\mathbb{H}$ is the complete graph on $[n]$) and the Tamari lattice for the associahedron (when $\\mathbb{H}$ is the set of all intervals of $[n]$), which motivates the study of lattice properties of hypergraphic posets.

Applied to a novel dataset on the backgrounds of Australian MPs in the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia (1947-2019), we show that our approach can help to describe and explain the decline in working-class and trade unionist MPs from the Labor Party, the homogeneous elitism of the mid-20 century Liberal Party, and the increasing similarity of both parties' professional networks, occuring in the period of party cartellisation from the 1980s onward. Our paper's finding show that our method has clear potential for broader applications in the study of political representation, diversity, and elite political networks.",

In this paper, we estimate the complete spectrum(adjacency and Seidel) and eigenvectors of the corona $G_0^* \\odot_1^n G_1^*$ of two hypergraphs when $G_1^*$ is regular. Additionally, we define the corona hypergraph $G_0^{*(m)}=G_0^{*(m-1)} \\odot_1^n G_0^*$ and determined its adjacency spectrum. Also, we extend the definition coronal of the adjacency matrix. Moreover, we estimate the characteristic polynomial of Seidel matrix of the generalised corona of hypergraphs. Applying these results, we obtain infinitely many non-regular non-isomorphic adjacency and Seidel cospectral hypergraphs.",

However, most existing methodologies for hypergraphs face significant limitations, including their heavy reliance on uniformity restrictions for hyperlink orders and their inability to account for repeated observations of identical hyperlinks. In this work, we introduce a novel and general latent embedding approach that addresses these challenges through the integration of latent embeddings, vertex degree heterogeneity parameters, and an order-adjusting parameter. Theoretically, we investigate the identifiability conditions for the latent embeddings and associated parameters, and we establish the convergence rates of their estimators along with asymptotic distributions. Computationally, we employ a projected gradient ascent algorithm for parameter estimation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and validate the theoretical findings. Moreover, an application to a co-citation hypergraph illustrates the advantages of the proposed method.",

A recently proposed adjacency tensor is applicable to nonuniform hypergraphs, but is prohibitively costly to form and analyze in practice. We develop tensor times same vector (TTSV) algorithms for this tensor which improve complexity from $O(n^r)$ to a low-degree polynomial in $r$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $r$ is the maximum hyperedge size. Our algorithms are implicit, avoiding formation of the order $r$ adjacency tensor. Here, we demonstrate the flexibility and utility of our approach in practice by developing tensor-based hypergraph centrality and clustering algorithms. We also show these tensor measures offer complementary information to analogous graph-reduction approaches on data, and are also able to detect higher-order structure that many existing matrix-based approaches provably cannot.",

In accordance with the standard theory for hypergraphs, this model is constructed from a bipartite graph. In our stochastic model, both vertex sets of this bipartite graph form marked Poisson point processes and the connection radius is inversely proportional to a product of suitable powers of the marks. Hence, our model is a common generalization of weighted random connection models and AB random geometric graphs. For this hypergraph model, we investigate the limit theory of a variety of graph-theoretic and topological characteristics such as higher-order degree distribution, Betti numbers of the associated Dowker complex as well as simplex counts. In particular, for the latter quantity we identify regimes of convergence to normal and to stable distribution depending on the heavy-tailedness of the weight distribution. We conclude our investigation by a simulation study and an application to the collaboration network extracted from the arXiv dataset.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world complex systems are characterized by non-pairwise -- higher-order -- interactions among system's units, and can be effectively modeled as hypergraphs. Directed hypergraphs distinguish between source and target sets within each hyperedge, and allow to account for the directional flow of information between nodes. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the structural organization of directed higher-order networks at their microscale. First, we extract the fingerprint of a directed hypergraph, capturing the frequency of hyperedges with a certain source and target sizes, and use this information to compute differences in higher-order connectivity patterns among real-world systems. Then, we formulate reciprocity in hypergraphs, including exact, strong, and weak definitions, to measure to which extent hyperedges are reciprocated. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs. We validate our framework on empirical datasets, including Bitcoin transactions, metabolic networks, and citation data, revealing structural principles behind the organization of real-world systems.",

Nonetheless, it remains challenging to transfer the success of these architectures to relational hypergraphs, where the task of link prediction is over $k$-ary relations, which is substantially harder than link prediction with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a framework for link prediction with relational hypergraphs, unlocking applications of graph neural networks to fully relational structures. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms and also via logical expressiveness. Empirically, we validate the power of the proposed model architectures on various relational hypergraph benchmarks. The resulting model architectures substantially outperform every baseline for inductive link prediction, and lead to state-of-the-art results for transductive link prediction.",

Writing $\\textrm{ex}_r ( N, \\mathcal{C}_{<g} )$ for this maximum, it is shown that $\\textrm{ex}_r ( N , \\mathcal{C}_{ < 5} ) = \\Omega_r ( N^{3/2 - o(1)} )$ for $r \\in \\{4,5,6 \\}$. We address an unproved claim from [31] asserting a technique of Ruzsa can be used to show that this lower bound holds for all $r \\geq 3$. We carefully explain one of the main obstacles that was overlooked at the time the claim from [31] was made, and show that this obstacle can be overcome when $r\\in \\{4,5,6\\}$. We use constructions from coding theory to prove nontrivial lower bounds that hold for all $r \\geq 3$. Finally, we use a recent result of Conlon, Fox, Sudakov, and Zhao to show that the sphere packing bound from coding theory may be improved when upper bounding the size of linear $q$-ary codes of distance $6$.",

Community structure is a common property observed in empirical networks in various domains. Stochastic block models have been employed to investigate community structure in networks. Node attribute data, often accompanying network data, has been found to potentially enhance the learning of community structure in dyadic networks. In this study, we develop a statistical framework that incorporates node attribute data into the learning of community structure in a hypergraph, employing a stochastic block model. We demonstrate that our model, which we refer to as HyperNEO, enhances the learning of community structure in synthetic and empirical hypergraphs when node attributes are sufficiently associated with the communities. Furthermore, we found that applying a dimensionality reduction method, UMAP, to the learned representations obtained using stochastic block models, including our model, maps nodes into a two-dimensional vector space while largely preserving community structure in empirical hypergraphs. We expect that our framework will broaden the investigation and understanding of higher-order community structure in real-world complex systems.",

One way to guarantee the existence of a full rainbow matching is to have the size of each color class $E_i$ be sufficiently large compared to the maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we apply a simple iterative method to construct edge-colored multi-hypergraphs with a given maximum degree, large color classes, and no full rainbow matchings. First, for every $r \\ge 1$ and $\\Delta \\ge 2$, we construct edge-colored $r$-uniform multi-hypergraphs with maximum degree $\\Delta$ such that each color class has size $|E_i| \\ge r\\Delta - 1$ and there is no full rainbow matching, which demonstrates that a theorem of Aharoni, Berger, and Meshulam (2005) is best possible. Second, we construct properly edge-colored multigraphs with no full rainbow matchings which disprove conjectures of Delcourt and Postle (2022). Finally, we apply results on full rainbow matchings to list edge-colorings and prove that a color degree generalization of Galvin's theorem (1995) does not hold.",

Among the various methods for solving the IM problem, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been shown to be particularly effective. While the literature on the topic is particularly ample, only a few attempts have been made at solving the IM problem over higher-order networks, namely extensions of standard graphs that can capture interactions that involve more than two nodes. Hypergraphs are a valuable tool for modeling complex interaction networks in various domains; however, they require rethinking of several graph-based problems, including IM. In this work, we propose a multi-objective EA for the IM problem over hypergraphs that leverages smart initialization and hypergraph-aware mutation. While the existing methods rely on greedy or heuristic methods, to our best knowledge this is the first attempt at applying EAs to this problem. Our results over nine real-world datasets and three propagation models, compared with five baseline algorithms, reveal that our method achieves in most cases state-of-the-art results in terms of hypervolume and solution diversity.",

Individuals who can be represented by nodes in a network may play different roles in the spreading process, and thus finding the most influential nodes in a network has become a crucial topic in network science for applications such as viral marketing, rumor suppression, and disease control. To solve the problem of identifying nodes that have high influence in a complex system, we propose a higher-order distance-based fuzzy centrality methods (HDF and EHDF) that are customized for a hypergraph which can characterize higher-order interactions between nodes via hyperedges. The methods we proposed assume that the influence of a node is reliant on the neighboring nodes with a certain higher-order distance. We compare the proposed methods with the baseline centrality methods to verify their effectiveness. Experimental results on six empirical hypergraphs show that the proposed methods could better identify influential nodes, especially showing plausible performance in finding the top influential nodes. Our proposed theoretical framework for identifying influential nodes could provide insights into how higher-order topological structure can be used for tasks such as vital node identification, influence maximization, and network dismantling.",

Although the existing vertex-based IM algorithms perform better than the hyperedge-based algorithms by generating random reverse researchable (RR) sets, they are inefficient because (i) they ignore important structural information associated with hyperedges and thus obtain inferior results, (ii) the frequently-used sampling methods for generating RR sets have low efficiency because of a large number of required samplings along with high sampling variances, and (iii) the vertex-based IM algorithms have large overheads in terms of running time and memory costs. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel approach, called \\emph{HyperIM}. The key idea behind \\emph{HyperIM} is to differentiate structural information of vertices for developing stratified sampling combined with highly-efficient strategies to generate the RR sets. With theoretical guarantees, \\emph{HyperIM} is able to accelerate the influence spread, improve the sampling efficiency, and cut down the expected running time. To further reduce the running time and memory costs, we optimize \\emph{HyperIM} by inferring the bound of the required number of RR sets in conjunction with stratified sampling. Experimental results on real-world hypergraphs show that \\emph{HyperIM} is able to reduce the number of required RR sets and running time by orders of magnitude while increasing the influence spread by up to $2.73X$ on average, compared to the state-of-the-art IM algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Recent papers initiated the study of a generalization of group testing where the potentially contaminated sets are the members of a given hypergraph F=(V,E). This generalization finds application in contexts where contaminations can be conditioned by some kinds of social and geographical clusterings. The paper focuses on few-stage group testing algorithms, i.e., slightly adaptive algorithms where tests are performed in stages and all tests performed in the same stage should be decided at the very beginning of the stage. In particular, the paper presents the first two-stage algorithm that uses o(dlog|E|) tests for general hypergraphs with hyperedges of size at most d, and a three-stage algorithm that improves by a d^{1/6} factor on the number of tests of the best known three-stage algorithm. These algorithms are special cases of an s-stage algorithm designed for an arbitrary positive integer s<= d. The design of this algorithm resort to a new non-adaptive algorithm (one-stage algorithm), i.e., an algorithm where all tests must be decided beforehand. Further, we derive a lower bound for non-adaptive group testing. For E sufficiently large, the lower bound is very close to the upper bound on the number of tests of the best non-adaptive group testing algorithm known in the literature, and it is the first lower bound that improves on the information theoretic lower bound Omega(log |E|).",

        "abstract": "In the fast-paced and volatile financial markets, accurately predicting stock movements based on financial news is critical for investors and analysts. Traditional models often struggle to capture the intricate and dynamic relationships between news events and market reactions, limiting their ability to provide actionable insights. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through the development of a Geometric Hypergraph Attention Network (GHAN) to analyze the impact of financial news on market behaviours. Geometric hypergraphs extend traditional graph structures by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, effectively modelling high-order relationships and interactions among financial entities and news events. This unique capability enables the capture of complex dependencies, such as the simultaneous impact of a single news event on multiple stocks or sectors, which traditional models frequently overlook. By incorporating attention mechanisms within hypergraphs, GHAN enhances the model's ability to focus on the most relevant information, ensuring more accurate predictions and better interpretability. Additionally, we employ BERT-based embeddings to capture the semantic richness of financial news texts, providing a nuanced understanding of the content. Using a comprehensive financial news dataset, our GHAN model addresses key challenges in financial news impact analysis, including the complexity of high-order interactions, the necessity for model interpretability, and the dynamic nature of financial markets. Integrating attention mechanisms and SHAP values within GHAN ensures transparency, highlighting the most influential factors driving market predictions. Empirical validation demonstrates the superior effectiveness of our approach over traditional sentiment analysis and time-series models.",

        "abstract": "Cooperation as a self-organized collective behavior plays a significant role in the evolution of ecosystems and human society. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a new perspective, distinct from imitation learning in evolutionary games, for exploring the mechanisms underlying its emergence. However, most existing studies with the public good game (PGG) employ a self-regarding setup or are on pairwise interaction networks. Players in the real world, however, optimize their policies based not only on their histories but also on the histories of their co-players, and the game is played in a group manner. In the work, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in the PGG under the other-regarding reinforcement learning evolutionary game (OR-RLEG) on hypergraph by combining the Q-learning algorithm and evolutionary game framework, where other players' action history is incorporated and the game is played on hypergraphs. Our results show that as the synergy factor increases, the parameter interval is divided into three distinct regions, the absence of cooperation (AC), medium cooperation (MC), and high cooperation (HC), accompanied by two abrupt transitions in the cooperation level near two transition points, respectively. Interestingly, we identify regular and anti-coordinated chessboard structures in the spatial pattern that positively contribute to the first cooperation transition but adversely affect the second. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical treatment for the first transition with an approximated first transition point and reveal that players with a long-sighted perspective and low exploration rate are more likely to reciprocate kindness with each other, thus facilitating the emergence of cooperation. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of human cooperation, where other-regarding information and group interactions are commonplace.",

Adjacency matrices of hypergraphs are contractions of adjacency tensors and their entries exhibit long range correlations.

Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\\left(\\frac{r\\log d}{(r-1)d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\\left(\\frac{\\log d}{(r-1)d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem. Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\\left(\\frac{r\\log d}{(r-1)d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\\left(\\frac{\\log d}{(r-1)d}\\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs. While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.",

Let $\\mathcal{G}$ be a hypergraph whose corank and rank are $c\\geq 3$ and $k$, respetively. The minimum $t$-degree of $\\mathcal{G}$ is the fewest number of edges containing every $t$-subset of vertices. An Euler tour (family, respectively) in $\\mathcal{G}$ is a (family of, respectively) closed walk(s) that (jointly, respectively) traverses each edge of $\\mathcal{G}$ exactly once. An Euler tour is spanning if it traverses all the vertices of $\\mathcal{G}$. We show that $\\mathcal{G}$ has an Euler family if its incidence graph is $(1+\\lceil k/c \\rceil)$-edge-connected. Provided that the number of vertices of $\\mathcal{G}$ meets a reasonable lower bound, and either $2$-degree is at least $k$ or $t$-degree is at least one for $t\\geq 3$, we show that $\\mathcal{G}$ has a spanning Euler tour. To exhibit the usefulness of our results, we solve a number of open problems concerning ordering blocks of a design (these have applications in other fields such as erasure-correcting codes).
